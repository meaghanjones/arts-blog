# Arts-blog

#### By _**Meaghan Jones and Matthew, August 2016**_

For this project we set out to practice the Ember concepts and tools we've been exploring this week by beginning a two-day project. The first day's focus lies in getting routing, templates, components and models in place for blog posts; including save, update, delete and find functionality. Day two focuses on implementing a one-to-many relationship between posts and comments.
